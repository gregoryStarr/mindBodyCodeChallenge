# Challenge Response
#### By: Gregory Starr
------------------------------

# Preface
I was not able to address the design aspect of your challenge.

# Requirements
You will need node to run this project
 on a mac you can use the following from the command line:
 ```brew install node```

 Once that's installed clone this repo and from the root directory in the command line type:
 ```npm i && npm start && npm run storybook```

 The above command install the project dependencies, starts the dev server (and opens a browser to the page), and finaly, I took the liberty of
 integrating a library called storybook. Open a browser and go to: http://localhost:7007/

 Storybook allows us to develope our components in isolation and helps povide a living style guide. I would suggest visiting this page first to get an idea of the compponents.

 The majority of my time was spent on a well structured, modern, project and cost me the time for wiring up design. Please reach out if yoou have difficulties of any kind, or questions I can answer.
